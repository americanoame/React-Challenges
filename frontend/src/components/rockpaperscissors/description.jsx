// 1) Start the Game Component

// Create a functional component called Game where all the logic for the Rock, Paper, Scissors game will live.


// 2) Set Up State

//Add three state variables:
// One to track the player's choice (e.g., "rock").
// One to track the computer's choice (e.g., "paper").
// One to store the result of the game (e.g., "You win!").


// 3)  Define Possible Choices

// Create a list of options: "rock", "paper", and "scissors" that both the player and computer can choose from.


// 4) Handle the Player's Choice

//When the player clicks a button, save their choice in the state.
// Randomly select one choice for the computer.
// Call a function to decide who wins.

// 5) Decide the Winner

//  Compare the player's choice and the computer's choice using simple rules:
// Rock beats scissors.
// Scissors beats paper.
// Paper beats rock.
// If both choices are the same, it’s a draw.
// Save the result (win, lose, or draw) in the state.


// 6) Render the Choices and Result

//  Show buttons for the player to pick "rock", "paper", or "scissors."
// Display the player’s choice, the computer’s choice, and the result of the game.

// 7) Test the Game

// Ensure the game updates the state and shows the correct result when the player makes a selection.

// 8) whoever  is right show a green button with the choice inside and whoever is wrong show a button a red butoon 
// wrong choice
